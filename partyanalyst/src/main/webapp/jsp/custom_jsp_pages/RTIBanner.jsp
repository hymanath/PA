	<h3>WHO CAN ASK FOR INFORMATION?</h3>
	<p style="padding-left:0px;margin-top:0px;">

 Any citizen can request for information by making an application in writing or through electronic means in English / Hindi / official language of the area, in which the application is being made, together with the prescribed fees.

	<h3>WHO WILL GIVE INFORMATION?</h3>

	<h3>How It Is Help</h3>
<p style="padding-left:0px;margin-top:0px;">
The right to information is a very important part of any true democracy. 
In a democracy, citizens need to know what their government is doing. 
They need to know this so that they can decide for themselves whether the government 
is doing what they think it should be doing.  I
f the citizens do not have information about their government, 
democracy becomes less meaningful. 
Citizens will not know enough about the government 
and its actions to be able to push the government to act in the "right" way.

In order for citizens to be able to participate effectively in democracy, 
they need information about government.  
This is why the right to information is so important.
